## Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs app in the dev mode.<br />
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm test`

Launches test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds app for production to `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`

**Irreversible!**

Removes build dependency from project.

Copies all config files and transitive dependencies to project. All commands except `eject` will still work, but will point to copied scripts.
